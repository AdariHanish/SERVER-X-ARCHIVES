# Control Flow Statements
---

### The if statement
---
The if statement is used to check a condition: if the condition is true, we run a block of statements (called the if-block), else we process another block of statements (called the else-block). The else clause is optional.

Consider an example : 

number = 23
guess = int(input('Enter an integer : '))

if guess == number:
    # New block starts here
    print('Congratulations, you guessed it.')
    print('(but you do not win any prizes!)')
    # New block ends here
elif guess < number:
    # Another block
    print('No, it is a little higher than that')
    # You can do whatever you want in a block ...
else:
    print('No, it is a little lower than that')
    # you must have guessed > number to reach here

print('Done')

Output:

$ python if.py
Enter an integer : 50
No, it is a little lower than that
Done

$ python if.py
Enter an integer : 22
No, it is a little higher than that
Done

$ python if.py
Enter an integer : 23
Congratulations, you guessed it.
(but you do not win any prizes!)
Done
