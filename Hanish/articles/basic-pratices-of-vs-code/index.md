Mastering Visual Studio Code: Best Practices and Valuable Insights
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has become one of the most popular code editors among developers due to its versatility, rich feature set, and extensibility. To help you make the most of VS Code, we've compiled a list of best practices and valuable insights.

1. Customize your workspace
VS Code allows you to customize your workspace by setting up user-defined keybindings, preferences, and installing extensions. This enables you to tailor the editor to your specific needs and workflow.

Keybindings: Customize your keybindings by going to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts (Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts on macOS) or by creating a keybindings.json file in your user settings directory.
User settings: Customize your user settings by going to File > Preferences > Settings (Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS) or by creating a settings.json file in your user settings directory.
Extensions: Enhance your VS Code experience by installing extensions from the VS Code Marketplace. Some popular extensions include GitLens, Prettier, and ESLint.
2. Use multiple cursors and selections
Multiple cursors and selections allow you to make simultaneous edits in multiple locations within your code. This can significantly speed up your editing process.

Add cursors: Add cursors by holding down Alt (Option on macOS) and clicking on the desired locations or by using keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl+Alt+Up (Cmd+Option+Up on macOS) and Ctrl+Alt+Down (Cmd+Option+Down on macOS).
Select multiple lines: Select multiple lines by holding down Shift and using the arrow keys or by clicking and dragging the mouse.
3. Utilize the integrated terminal
VS Code's integrated terminal provides a seamless experience for running shell commands and managing your project's file system.

Terminal profiles: Create terminal profiles for different shells or configurations by going to Terminal > Configure Terminal (Terminal > Select Default Shell on macOS).
Split terminals: Split your terminal into multiple panes for better multitasking by using keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl+Shift+ (Cmd+Shift+ on macOS) and Ctrl+Shift+`` (Cmd+Shift+`` on macOS).
4. Leverage Git integration
VS Code's built-in Git integration allows you to perform version control tasks directly within the editor.

GitLens: Install the GitLens extension to gain access to advanced Git features, such as line-by-line history, blame annotations, and repository insights.
Source Control view: Access the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G or Cmd+Shift+G on macOS) to view and manage your Git repositories.
5. Employ IntelliSense and code snippets
IntelliSense and code snippets help you write code more efficiently by providing context-aware suggestions and predefined code templates.

IntelliSense: Use IntelliSense to get suggestions for functions, variables, and methods by typing the opening parenthesis, quote, or bracket of the element.
Code snippets: Create and use custom code snippets by going to File > Preferences > User Snippets (Code > Preferences > User Snippets on macOS) or by installing extension-provided snippets.
6. Optimize performance
Optimize VS Code's performance by disabling unnecessary features and extensions.

Settings: Adjust settings such as files.exclude and search.exclude to exclude unnecessary files and directories from indexing.
Extensions: Disable or uninstall extensions that are not essential to your workflow or that negatively impact performance.
By following these best practices and valuable insights, you can enhance your productivity and efficiency when working with Visual Studio Code.
