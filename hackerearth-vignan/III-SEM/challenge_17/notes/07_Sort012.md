# <span style="color:#1AED59"> Q. **Sort Os, 1s, and 2s**</span>

Given an array of size N containing only Os, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

## <span style="color:cyan"> **Logic Approach** </span>

The logical approach for Sort 0 1 2 is as follows:

1. Keep three counters c1 to count 0s, c2 to count 1s, and c3 to count 2s
2. Traverse through the array and increase the count of c1 if the element is 0, increase the count of c2 if the element is 1 and increase the count of c3 if the element is 2
3. Now again traverse the array and replace the first c1 elements with 0, the next c2 elements with 1, and the next c3 elements with 2.

```c
// PROBLEM: Sort 0s, 1s and 2s
// AUTHOR: Geetika Nahak

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int c1 = 0, c2 = 0, c3 = 0;
    int a[n];
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        switch (a[i]) {
        case 0:
            c1++;
            break;
        case 1:
            c2++;
            break;
        case 2:
            c3++;
            break;
        }
    }
    i = 0;
    while (c1 > 0) {
        a[i++] = 0;
        c1--;
    }
    while (c2 > 0) {
        a[i++] = 1;
        c2--;
    }
    while (c3 > 0) {
        a[i++] = 2;
        c3--;
    }
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", a[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
